# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
# VERY important general considerations for claude code
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to claude_steps directory.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

## Important considerations for Claude Code
- each time you want to make a big change to the code (not small fixes), please first check the `CLAUDE.md` file to see if there are any specific instructions or considerations for that change.
- each time you want to add a new feature or modify the existing functionality, please ensure that you add an md file claude_steps directory which will be numbered from 1 upwards.
- always ask me about the plan you have in mind before you store the step in the claude_steps directory.
- you are allowed to search online to use any search engine such as Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo to find information about the code or the project.
- you are allowed to search withing the repository to find information about the code or the project.
